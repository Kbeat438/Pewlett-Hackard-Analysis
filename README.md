# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to check to see which employees are eligible to retire and also which employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
## Results:
- There are 133,776 employees eligible to retire
- Of those 133,776 , there are 90,398 unique titles
- There are about 25,000 senior staff and Senior Engineers who are eligible to retire. 
- There are 1,549 employees who can be be admitted into the mentorship program


## Summary:
This data gives us good insight into the large amount of employees that are eligibile to retire. A lot of hiring is going to need to take place soon. Two questions this data brings up is which titles need to be filled with the most priority and can we continue to operate without filling in the manager position (because 2 managers of 24 is'nt a ton). Two tables we could make to help better understand this data and what we should do with it are a table to pair the 1,549 mentees with the youngest starting employee in their department with their title and a table that shows the ratio of the employees leaving for each position and the employees their currently are so we can find out how many need to be hired and if we need more expertise in that area.
